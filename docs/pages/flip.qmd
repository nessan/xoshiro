title: "`xso::generator` --- Coin Flips & Dice Rolls"
---

We have a method that returns the result of flipping a possibly biased coin and another that returns the result of rolling a fair dice with an arbitrary number of sides:
```cpp
constexpr bool flip(double p = 0.5);        // <1>
constexpr int  roll(int n = 6);             // <2>
```
1. Returns the result of flipping a coin where `p` is the probability of getting a `true` result.
2. Returns an integer in the range $[1, n]$, where each number is equally likely to be returned.

[Example:]{.bt}

```cpp
#include <xoshiro.h>
int main()
{
    xso::rng gen;
    std::size_t n_trials = 600'000;
    std::size_t count = 0;
    for(std::size_t n = 0; n < n_trials; ++n) if(gen.flip()) count++;
    std::cout << count << " heads from " << n_trials << " fair coin flips.\n";

    count = 0;
    for(std::size_t n = 0; n < n_trials; ++n) if(gen.roll() == 4) count++;
    std::cout << count << " fours from " << n_trials << " six-sided dice rolls.\n";
}
```

[Output: Varies from run to run]{.bt}
```bash
299620 heads from 600000 fair coin flips.
100061 fours from 600000 six-sided dice rolls.
```
