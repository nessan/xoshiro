title: "`xso::generator` --- Precomputed Characteristics"
---

We have a class method that returns the *precomputed* lower-order coefficients of the characteristic polynomial associated with the `State`.
```cpp
static constexpr state_type characteristic_coefficients();
```
Calls to this method will fail at compile time if no such coefficients are embedded in the `xoshiro.h` header file.
Calls will succeed for all the [type aliased] recommended generators.

## Summary

Suppose that the generator's has $n$ bits of state packed into $n_w$ words.

The corresponding transition matrix over $\FF$ will be $n \times n$ and will be of full rank with a monic characteristic polynomial:
$$
    c(x) = x^n + p(x).
$$
The polynomial $p(x)$ is the lower-order piece of $c(x)$ and is of degree less than $n$:
$$
    p(x) = p_0 + p_1 x + \cdots + p_{n-1} x^{n-1}.
$$
Each coefficient $p_i$ is either 0 or 1 and we can pack the $n$ coefficients of $p(x)$ into $n_w$ words.

A successful call to the `characteristic_coefficients()` class method returns the coefficients of $p(x)$ in a standard array of $n_w$ words.

## The Details

See the [jump technique] page for details on how the polynomial $p(x)$ is used in practice.
