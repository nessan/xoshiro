title: "`xso::generator` --- Discard Method"
---

We have an instance method to advance the state while ignoring the generated outputs.

```cpp
constexpr void discard(std::uint64_t n);    // <1>
```
1. Calls the {step} method `n` times without recording any output.

CAUTION: The `discard()` method is a slow and *dumb* approach to advancing the state ahead in its orbit.
For large values of `n`, the same thing is achieved much more efficiently by using the {jump} methods.

[Example:]{.bt}
```cpp
#include <xoshiro.h>
int main()
{
    xso::rng f;                             // <1>
    xso::rng g = f;                         // <2>

    std::size_t n = 10;
    std::cout << "Calling f() " << n << " times:\n";
    for (std::size_t i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
        std::cout << "Call " << i << ": f() = " << f() << '\n';

    std::cout << "Making sure the jumped forward copy of f matches:\n";
    g.discard(n);                           // <3>
    std::cout << "f() = " << f() << '\n';   // <4>
    std::cout << "g() = " << g() << '\n';
}
```
1. Create a randomly seeded RNG.
2. Make a copy of that generator --- one with the exact same state.
3. We have called `f()` multiple times and now get `g` to the same point by using the `discard` method.
4. One more call to `f()` and `g()` to demonstrate they have reached the identical point in their random number streams.

[Output: Varies from run to run]{.bt}
```bash
Calling f() 10 times:
Call 0: f() = 14005126867685016518
Call 1: f() = 10640180379987258470
Call 2: f() = 16367042443805637715
Call 3: f() = 10852054829793099863
Call 4: f() = 17355665557991136519
Call 5: f() = 17884768122497745551
Call 6: f() = 8981322931967380562
Call 7: f() = 9724290714337168340
Call 8: f() = 11553202802824749703
Call 9: f() = 5222239817378406001
Making sure the jumped forward copy of f matches:
f() = 14624851349943862646
g() = 14624851349943862646
