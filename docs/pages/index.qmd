title: The `xoshiro`Library
---

## Introduction

David Blackman and Sebastiano Vigna introduced the {xoshiro-xoroshiro} class of pseudorandom number generators, which are very efficient and, though they have relatively small states, display excellent statistical properties.
The mathematical details are to be found in their {paper}.

`xoshiro.h` is a single header file, {cpp}  implementation of the *complete* family of these generators.

The implementations satisfy {cpp}'s {std.uniform_random_bit_generator} concept and can drive any of the distributions defined in the standard library.

We also provide efficient jump-ahead methods for *arbitrary* jump sizes, making these generators particularly suitable for parallel processing applications. They are excellent replacements for the "standard" _Mersenne Twister_ generator.

While the implementation is very general, there are simple type aliases for specific preferred instantiations that are known to work well in most situations.

## Example

Here is a simple example where we use the *default xoshiro* generator `xso::rng` to sample a normal distribution from the standard library.

This is identical to the code shown on the {std.normal_distribution} webpage except that we use `xso::rng` as a drop-in replacement for the `std::mersenne_twister_engine`.


```cpp
#include <xoshiro.h>                            // <1>
#include <random>
#include <map>
#include <iomanip>

int main()
{
    xso::rng gen;                               // <2>

    // lambda: draws a sample from a normal distribution and rounds it to an integer.
    std::normal_distribution d{5.0, 2.0};
    auto random_int = [&d, &gen] { return int(std::round(dist(gen))); };

    // Run many trials and create a histogram of the results in integer buckets.
    std::map<int, int> hist{};
    for (int n = 0; n != 25'000; ++n) ++hist[random_int()];

    // Print that histogram.
    for (auto [bucket, count] : hist) {
        auto n = static_cast<std::size_t>(count / 100);
        std::cout << std::setw(2) << bucket << ' ' << std::string(n, '*') << '\n';
    }
}
```
1. Everything is in the single `xoshiro.h` header file. The classes, functions, etc., are all in the `xso` namespace.
2. This type alias for xso::rng64 produces 64-bit outputs from a specific *xoshiro* generator with 256 bits of state.

## Installation

This library is header-only, so there is nothing to compile & link --- drop the `xoshiro.h` file somewhere convenient, and you are good to go.

Alternatively, if you are using `CMake`, you can use the standard `FetchContent` module by adding a few lines to your project's `CMakeLists.txt` file:

```cmake
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(xoshiro URL https://github.com/nessan/bit/releases/download/current/xoshiro.zip)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(xoshiro)
```

This command downloads and unpacks an archive of the current version of `xoshiro` to your project's build folder.
You can then add a dependency on `xoshiro::xoshiro`, a `CMake` alias for `xoshiro`.
`FetchContent` will automatically ensure the build system knows where to find the downloaded header files and any needed compiler flags.

Used like this, `FetchContent` will only download a minimal library version without any redundant test code, sample programs, documentation files, etc.

NOTE: The shown `URL` gets the `current` version of the library --- whatever is in the main branch.
For a fixed, stable library version (say release `2.0.0`), use a `URL` parameter like: `https://github.com/nessan/xoshiro/releases/download/2.0.0/xoshiro.zip`.

## Implementation

`C` versions of the generators are available on the {xoshiro-xoroshiro} website.
Wrapping those routines to conform to the {std.uniform_random_bit_generator} concept is trivial.

Our implementation in `xoshiro.h` is distinguished in several other ways:

### Generality

Using `xoshiro.h` you can create *any* member of the *xoshiro/xoroshiro* family.

We have {State} classes that are templatized across the number of state bits, and the parameters (labelled `A`, `B`, and `C` in the literature) that determine how the state is advanced from step to step.

{Scrambler} classes are templatized across the other parameters (labelled `R`, `S`, and `T` in the literature) that determine how the higher dimensional state is scrambled/reduced to single 32-bit or 64-bit output words.

This means you can instantiate *any* generator in the *xoshiro/xoroshiro* family.

NOTE: For the reasonable optimization levels you are likely to employ in any numerical code, the {cpp}  versions perform identically to the simpler-looking `C` versions linked above.

### Simplicity

While you can instantiate *any* generator in the *xoshiro/xoroshiro* family, we also recognize that only a limited number of those generators have been vetted for suitability as being "good".

Therefore, we provide  recommended {type-aliased} default generators you should use in most cases.

### Arbitrary Jumps

We provide methods to advance a generator by *arbitrary* and potentially huge numbers of steps.
This contrasts with the `C` versions, which only define a limited number of jump possibilities.

Huge jumps are used to *partition* a single random number stream into non-overlapping sub-streams.
In parallel processing applications, the sub-streams drive independent jobs running on different compute cores.

### Sampling Methods

The {cpp} standard library follows a typical design pattern for the facilities in its standard {std.random} header.
It maintains a strict separation between the classes that produce random bits and others that use those bits.

Uniform random bit generators produce streams of *uniformly* distributed output words (usually 32-bit or 64-bit unsigned integers).
Other classes and functions shape those core streams to simulate a desired distribution over some field of interest (for example, to generate variates from a uniform distribution of reals in the range 0 to 1).

The idea is reasonable enough.
You can swap out the uniform random bit generator for a better one and continue to use the other functions without change.

However, this interface is quite complicated for the end user --- particularly for a user with no idea, or interest in, how all the generator/distribution machinery works.

Perhaps she googles "`c++ random number generator`" and get advice to use the {std.mersenne_twister_engine} class.
However, by itself, that class only produces unsigned output words that are useless by themselves.
To simulate something as simple as a die roll, she must feed the thing into some other class and use that to get the required effect.

For this reason, we enrich our *xoshiro/xoroshiro* classes with some utility methods that interface *directly* with the various distribution classes in the standard {std.random} header.
That dice roll becomes something as simple as:

```cpp
xso::rng gen;
std::cout << "Six sided dice roll: " << gen.roll() << '\n';
```

Similarly, you can ask one of our generators to flip a coin or shuffle the elements in a container.

Our generators also directly support *sampling*.
This includes pulling samples from a range, container, or an arbitrary distribution.

Here are some examples:

```cpp
std::cout << gen.sample(1, 10)   << '\n';   // <1>
std::cout << gen.sample(1., 10.) << '\n';   // <2>

std::normal_distribution nd{70., 15.};
std::cout << gen.sample(nd);                // <3>

std::array<double, 10> v;
gen.sample(nd, v.begin(), v.word_count());  // <4>

std::array<double, 5> u;
gen.sample(v, u.begin(), u.word_count());   // <5>

ge.shuffle(u);                              // <6>
```
1. Prints a random integer from $[1,10]$, where each integer is equally likely to occur.
2. Prints a random real from a uniform distribution over $[1,10)$
3. Prints a random variate from a normal distribution with mean 70 and standard deviation 15.
4. Fills an array `v` with 10 random variates from that same distribution.
5. Fills an array `u` with 5 elements drawn from `v` without replacement.
6. Shuffles the elements of `u`.

NOTE: Of course, the generators can also still be used as uniform random bit generators.
The extra sampling methods etc. just make them much more useful out of the box.

### Extra Analysis

Extra non-member functions for generator analysis are defined if the {bit.lib} library is available.

`bit` is a {cpp}  library for doing linear algebra over {gf2} the simplest Galois field of two elements $\{0,1\}$, where the usual arithmetic operations are performed mod 2.
The `bit` library is header-only, so it can be easily incorporated into any application.

If it is available, then `xoshiro.h` defines some extra functions that let you access the generator's *transition matrix* and use/analyze that in various ways.

NOTE: Even if you only use the single `xoshiro.h` header file without incorporating the `bit` library, you can still jump any of the predefined type-aliased *xoshiro/xoroshiro* variants by *arbitrary* numbers of steps.
