title: "`xso::generator` --- Read Access to the State"
---

We have methods that provide read-only access to the state:

```cpp
constexpr word_type operator[](std::size_t i) const;    // <1>

template<typename Iter>
constexpr void get_state(Iter dst) const;        // <2>
```
1. Read-only access to the word `i` of state.
2. Copies the whole state into the destination `dst`.

WARNING: The index `i` should be less than `word_count()`.
Calls with larger values of `i` will result in undefined behaviour.

[Example:]{.bt}
```cpp
#include <xoshiro.h>
int main()
{
    xso::rng g0(1);                                             // <1>
    xso::rng g1(2);

    for(std::size_t i = 0; i < xso::rng::word_count(); ++i) {
        std::cout << "g0[" << i << "] = " << g0[i] << '\t';     // <2>
        std::cout << "g1[" << i << "] = " << g1[i] << '\n';
    }
}
```
1. Create a pair of generators that are seeded from neighbouring integers.
2. Print each word of state for the two generators.

[Output: Varies from run to run]{.bt}
```bash
g0[0] = 2973750756608955175     g1[0] = 17576013672004619970    # <1>
g0[1] = 11413743089567126834    g1[1] = 16442790642303457438
g0[2] = 4383533935485149688     g1[2] = 3610580237369810524
g0[3] = 3535799440905119283     g1[3] = 11046704898693758421
```
1. Seeded `g0` and `g1` with neighbouring values. \
{SplitMix} was used to mix those seeds up and get them to very different underlying state arrays.
